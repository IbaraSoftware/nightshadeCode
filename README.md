###### nightshadeCode's text editor.

**nightshadeCode** is now live on GH Pages - visit it [here](https://nightshade-foundation.github.io/nightshadeCode/) and get to programming in the cloud!

### What Does nightshadeCode Do? 

It is a simple webpage that allows anyone to write code without needing to download a lot of things to their local computer. Don't have access to your IDE, or just want to code up a quick concept? This is a great place for you to do it, without the need to worry about downloading development software and the like.
